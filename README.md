C2 Tracker
Ah, so ye've stumbled upon me little pet project, have ye? Well, grab a pint and settle in, 'cause this one’s a work in progress.

🍀 What’s This All About?
This is a simple tool for tracking C2 servers, built just for the craic (and maybe a bit of learning, too). At the moment, it’s got the basics:

HTTP Header Analysis – Sniffing out them suspicious headers.

OSINT Integration – Pulling in some open-source magic.

Netlas API Support – A wee bit of automation never hurt anyone.

⚒️ Still a Work in Progress
Aye, it’s far from perfect. The plan is to refine it, add more detection methods, and maybe make it a proper useful tool. But for now, it’s just a bit of fun and learning.

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo:


git clone https://github.com/shKiev/C2-Tracker.git
cd C2-Tracker
Install dependencies (if needed).

Compile the code and run it.
